## Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
plastic_waste <- read.csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Here is the plastic-waste-continent data plotted as a frequency graph 

```{r plastic-waste-continent}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

Here is the dataset filtered so that it only shows countries with plastic waste per capita that is greater than 3.5kg per person
```{r filtered_plasticwastecontinent}

plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```
This shows that the outlier from the previous graph is Trinidad and Tobago. This means that this country has a much higher rate of plastic waste per capita compared to the other countries in this dataset. Quickly looking online, it seems that this is not a "data error" and that much of this is caused by "inadequate waste management" (according to Forbes)


Below shows each continent as a density plot.

```{r desnsityplotbycontinent}

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density()

```

This graph is similar but has all the continents filled in.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```


### Exercise 2


"2.1. Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha level that works better for displaying the density curves for all continents."

```{r plastic-waste-density}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.25)
```


"2.2. Explain why we defined the color and fill of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot but we defined the alpha level as a characteristic of the plotting geom."

'aes' is used to communicate to R what data to use whereas 'geom' says how to display that data. In the graph above, the x axis displays plastic waste per capita while color and fill display continent. These are under the 'aes' function in R. Alpha refers to the color transparency which is a quality of the data visualization rather than identifying the data itself.

And yet another way to visualize this relationship is using side-by-side box plots."


Here is a density plot with a lower alpha to better display the data.
